**_INTRO_**

After some time using and getting annoyed with the repetitiveness of SteamCMD, I looked around for a tool to automate at least some of process of installing an Arma 3 server and managing workshop mods. Having looked through a few options, none of which matched what i was looking for I decided it would be easier to build it myself. F.A.S.T. is the result of that, this is the first iteration and I will continue to expand and update it as and when needed.  Thanks go out to Optix for his Remote Arma Server tool that gave me some ideas for my tool. Also, a massive thank you to Kju and Friznit for testing and bug reporting for me.

 

**_PREREQUISITES_**

- Steam account with valid copy of Arma 3.
- Basic understanding of Arma 3 dedicated servers.

_**ISSUES AND FEEDBACK**_

I'll monitor the BI Forums thread as best as i can but I will use this GitHub Repo for bugs, issues and feature suggestions.   

 

_**DEV BRANCH WARNING**_

Due to the available server builds on steam, to install a dev branch server you must install the main Arma 3 application dev branch then launch using the included server binaries. Due to the way SteamCMD works this means that any mods that the account used to install the server is subscribed to will also be downloaded and updated when using Dev Branch. Currently these mods are mot detected/ added to F.A.S.T. but this will be added in future.

          

_**DOCUMENTATION**_

Is currently minimal, and found on the BI Forums Topic. I will update the wiki here at some point.
